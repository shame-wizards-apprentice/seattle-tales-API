API for the only game with a glow-in-the-dark lizard (as far as I know)

 ## Storyline: 
POV: You are an exterminator. You get a call from a rude customer, and the address takes you to some sort of weird dilapidated building. You take a step inside, and immediately fall down a manhole cover or something into an underground tunnel.

-You are greeted by a lizard (not a giant lizard or anything, just a lizard) who tells you he called TWO WEEKS AGO and can’t BELIEVE he hasn’t gotten service by now. He says he just moved into the tunnel and found that it’s infested with snails, and that he called a human exterminator because he heard humans are good at eradicating things. He asks if you will help him. 

If you say no: You are immediately taken to a “roll credits” screen, which insults you (i.e., “are you kidding me? Do you know how hard we worked on this game? Why’d you even pick it up then, huh? Honestly idk why I even BOTHER” etc, etc) 

If you say yes: You discover the lizard glows in the dark, allowing you to see more of the tunnel. The lizard guides you to the “Floating Marketplace,” which is actually a marketplace on the back of a giant tortoise. On the way, you see posters advertising the CDC, or the Coalition for Dark Creatures.

-The giant tortoise sells you bait to round up the snails, and some sort of weapons to fight off your enemies. He only has a certain amount of items available at any given time, and you place orders from his inventory. You can also buy food for the lizard, which makes it glow in the dark so you can see further in front of you.
-You will run into other merchants selling a wider variety of things. There is a 50% chance the merchant will be a pirate in disguise, and you will be asked if you wish to fight.
If you say yes: turn-based combat that gives you free items if you win, and takes away your items or health if you lose

If you say no: you must outrun the pirate to avoid having your stuff stolen

-You round up the snails, and then discover that you also must round up subsequent creatures of increasing size and difficulty. The lizard will guide you through the tunnels, and help you in a rude and sassy manner the whole time. During your journey, you start to see Wanted posters that kind of look like you mixed in with the CDC posters.

-After you’ve rounded up all the creatures, you’re greeted by the leader of the CDC as the final boss fight (troll?) At this point, it is revealed that the lizard is an evil invasive species and his light is not native to the underground tunnels. He wants to take over the tunnels, and eventually the world. You get a choice to continue fighting with the lizard (and fight the CDC), or to switch sides (and fight the lizard).

If you choose the lizard: You fight the head of the CDC. If you win, you receive an invitation to a dinner party with the COG (or the Creatures of Glow), and the tunnels have been transformed and lit up with glowing lizards. 

If you choose the CDC: You fight the lizard. If you win, you receive a letter from the CDC thanking you for your service and informing you that the tunnels have been sealed and humans aren’t going to be able to get in.
